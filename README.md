# Otonomo Front End (Short) Exercise
Hi and welcome to Otonomo :)

Below is a short exercise in ReactJS, it should take about one or two hours. 

This repo is already configured with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) boilerplate so you don't have to setup the boring stuff, just add the required React components.

## Folder Structure
Besides `create-react-app` boilerplate, we've added:

## TODO
- [ ] Complete README
- [ ] Complete Spec. 
- [ ] Test everything
